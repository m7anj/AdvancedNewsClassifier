Advanced News Classifier
A machine learning project that automatically categorizes news articles using natural language processing.
What it does
Takes news articles and figures out what category they belong to. Uses neural networks and word embeddings to understand the text and make predictions.
How it works

Text cleaning - Removes unwanted characters and formats the text
NLP processing - Uses Stanford CoreNLP to break down sentences and find root words
Word embeddings - Converts words to numbers using GloVe vectors
Neural network - Trains a model to classify articles into different categories

Tech used

Java - Main programming language
Stanford CoreNLP - For text processing and lemmatization
DeepLearning4J - Neural network framework
GloVe - Pre-trained word vectors

Key features

Handles multiple news categories
Custom vector operations for semantic analysis
Optimized training with Adam optimizer
Text preprocessing pipeline with stop-word removal

Built as part of university coursework to learn about machine learning and NLP techniques.
